# New Year, New Site, New You?

I'm generally not one for New Year's Resolutions, but this year I thought of one that might actually be keepable, and I'm putting it on the internet to hold me accountable.

## The Problem?
###### Miniatures

That's right, I'm not buying *any* miniatures in the year 2026. But there's already two caveats to this rule:
1. 3d printing miniatures doesn't count.
2. If I sell miniatures I currently have, I can use that money to buy miniatures. Or make trades with my current kits. Net-zero and all that.

I find myself bouncing from project to project a lot, so I would like to think this will force me to work through my Pile(s) of Shame, which is as follows:

**40k**
- Triarch Preatorians *
- Sunshark Bomber
- Stormsurge
- Retribution Cadre
- Miasmic Malignifier (going to be used for a Necromunda terrain plate)
- Biovore *
- Tyrannofex *
- Hammerfall Bunker (going to be used for a Necromunda terrain plate)

(* I don't even pretent to play these factions anymore, and as I write this I realize I'm missing at least one box of 'Nids but I might have put that in storage somewhere)

**Age of Sigmar**
- Tzarketh
- Skaven Doomwheel
- Skaven Doomwheel
- Verminlord

**Necromunda**
- Delaque Nacht-Ghuul & Friends box
- Hive Scum
- Ambots
- Underhive Market

I do also have parts of the Zone Mortalis tiles and stairs and doors sets, but those are being actively used to make custom terrain plates.

**Kill Team**
- Shrine Statue (going to be used for a Necromunda terrain plate)
- Space Marines Scouts (old 40k box, before the bespoke kit came out)
- Space Marines Scouts (old 40k box, before the bespoke kit came out)
- Legionairies
- Pink Horrors (was part of a Compendium team before the version rollover killed it)

**Others**
- Battletech Clan Direct Fire Box
- Battletech Legendary Mechwarriors III Box
- Blood Bowl Gnome Treeman
- Quar Clash of Ryfles Box

This is only the boxes I can see on my shelves, not counting half built or half painted models.
Please enjoy these images of my Pile(s) of Shame with as little judgement as possible:

## The Solution

To help with the whole not buying kits and staying on target for building and painting kits I already own, I created an overengineered spreadsheet to track all of this. Because everyone loves a good spreadsheet.

{{< figure

	alt="so many cells for so many stats"
	class="mw-50"
>}}

It allows me to track the models I build, paint, and see how many in game points and retail value they're worth. Maybe I'll even add some graphs eventutally. (This image is using dummy data for explination purposes).

Anyway, that's all. Expect updates on the Pile(s) of Shame progress.
