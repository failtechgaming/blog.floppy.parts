# January Monthly Painting Wrap Up

I admit I'm writing this a little before the end of the month, but I'm also realistic I'm not going to finish anything new in the next two days. The first month of "no buy, all paint" 2026 was off to a good start. 

<!--more-->

Finished up the last four Skaville Skablins linesplayers (painted this month), and started work on two of the specialist positionals, the 'Ooligan and the Loony. Turns out, the specialist positionals have a lot more details and thus a lot more decisions need to be made on how to paint them. Guess that's what happens with the center-pieces of your team and whatnot. That's not even counting the second Trained Troll I haven't even assembled yet (though that's probably a next-season problem). I even got the base numbers applied and grass flocked, so here's a little sub-team photo of them all.

(The Blue Meanies don't currently have numbers because they're "Journeymen" players who only sub in for injuries and thus don't level up, but I might throw some high numbers on them eventually)

In addition to the Blood Bowl work, which is still the priority, I did a little of what I like to call "clearing off my painting desk," which is really just finishing whatever half-forgotten paint projects I have cluttering up my painting space. So I finished up two Gaslands cars and four pieces of Gaslands terrain.

The two cars had been sitting with some rough base coating on my desk for a number of months. The terrain pieces were all From-Zero pieces.

The two cars are mechanically trucks fitted with Wall of Speakers, though they're just boxy 90s sedans because I like that aesthetic better (and also it's hard to find open back Hot Wheels trucks). So we have Flutter and Wow. In game, they would ideally work side-by-side, hitting enemy cars with their speakers and cause them to flip. The downside is because they're trucks with speakers, they're pretty pricy, Cans-wise (the Gaslands currency). So they usually only have a cheap buggy to back them up.

The terrain was pretty straight-forward. Three pieces, the rail barriers, are 3d printed with a silver metal spray, some freehand graffitti, and oil wash. Quick turnaround. The wrecked car was a little more involved, in that I took a Hot Wheels car I didn't care for (some sort of PT Cruiser looking thing?), hit it with a rubber mallet for a while, then gave it a zenithal spray, contrest paints, and oil wash. Other than the "hitting it with a hammer" part, another quick project to get off my table.

So that brings us to the end of the month wrap-up. The 'Ooligan and Loony are still outstanding, but should be on the Feb wrap-up. Ten total miniatures painted, with a retail value worth just under $23. That's a net 10 miniatures painted with zero new miniatures purchased in 2026.
