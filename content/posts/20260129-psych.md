# I lied

Turns out I was able to crank out one more painted model during a conference call.

Sometimes you just need to paint a clanrat to cleanse your palate. I have so many Skaven just lying around on my desk and shelves, I pick one up every so often to paint as a single model between other projects. This one had some base layers already blocked out, so I just slapped on a few more layers and washes. Quick and dirty, just like the Skaven themseves.

 This brings the total painted models for Janurary to 11, and tips the retail total to $25.55.
