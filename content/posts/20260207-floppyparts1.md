# We're so back

Time to check them floppies.

<!--more-->

## Disk 1

The first disk has some half-torn "memo 7671" page taped to it. Looks like it says "208 ups Act share 144-1." Or something.

![Disk cover](/images/20260207/disk1cover.jpg "Disk 1") 

Opening up the disk is a bunch of install files, which isn't going to work on our test system and I'm too lazy to try to actually install ACT! (spoilers) on the W98 machine.

![Disk contents](/images/20260207/disk1contents.png "files") 

The .ini file gives us the hint on what this actually is for - Symantec ACT! 2.0, or Activity Control Technology. For traveling sales people.

## Disk 2

A plain blue disk with "Graphics" written in sharpie in probably worse handwritting than mine. 

![disk 2](/images/20260207/disk2.jpg "disk 2")

Opening it up shows us ... some graphics. And a Word doc. The Word doc appears to be a list of what needs to be taught for a technology class, specifically about a phone system I believe.

The cover letter .rtf actually explains a little about what is going on. Astute listeners may recall the Industrial Corn Dogs disk from the beforetimes. (Names omitted to protect the innocent, but it is one we've seen before.)

And finally, whatever these corporate-ass images are.

## Disk 3

![disk 3](/images/20260207/disk3.jpg "disk 3")

Not 21, not 23. But 22. This one is a bit of a gold mind, but it's some files we've seen before, and some that may need some extensive covering-up. Ultimately, it's a collection of resumes and cover letters.

![disk 3](/images/20260207/disk3contents.png "disk 3 contents")

Sadly, we could not access the My Money Backup. 

![disk 3](/images/20260207/disk3letter1.png "disk 3 letter")

These do largely appear to be blank forms that the user could just drop in whatever job or reference they needed to. I was always told to tailor the cover letter to the job, but then again I never had to go in and give the manager a firm handjob either.

![disk 3](/images/20260207/disk3letter2.png "disk 3 letter")

You know what? Fuck it, we've seen the name Q Train before and that company doesn't even exist anymore. For context, this disk has cover letters for 2 different people - this is a letter for the second person, but they read basically the same.

![disk 3](/images/20260207/disk3letter3.png "disk 3 letter")

For example, the letter above is the same person as the second letter, but for a different job. Almost nothing has changed. I am making a point to cut off the letterhead you see in the first letter. We're skipping the INDMDCNT.doc because it's the exact same.

The next file is one of three resumes - these people each have an individual resume, and then an insane joint resume. It's like that scene from Always Sunny where Mac and Charlie try to get hired for the same job.

![disk 3](/images/20260207/disk3letter5.1.png "disk 3 letter")
![disk 3](/images/20260207/disk3letter5.2.png "disk 3 letter")

Some real bizzaro formatting on this first resume.

![disk 3](/images/20260207/disk3letter6.1.png "disk 3 letter")

Even though I'm blanking out the names, I felt like I had to include the letterhead to show the sheer audacity of a joint resume.

![disk 3](/images/20260207/disk3letter7.png "disk 3 letter")

Sadly the rest of the docs aren't as intersting. NEWJOB.doc appears to be some kind of spreadsheet (in a word doc!) of open positions. I assume RESIGN.doc is a template resignation letter but it's password locked. I guess these two were ready to dip at a moment's notice.

There you have it. Three new hot flops dropped in your ... lop.
