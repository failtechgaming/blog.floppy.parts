# First Blood (or paint)

At the end of December, I was really pumped to start painting immedately after the start of year so I could start racking up the points on my fake, made up paint points chart. I didn't get a good start until I recovered from the 'vid, which I contracted over the holiday.

But I finally got paint on models and put a few points up on the board. With the upcoming Blood Bowl League, all my attention right now is to paint the rest of the Skaville Skablins. So I finished up two goblin linesplayers for the Skaville Skablins, players number 13 and 14. They don't currently have names as the starting lineup for the Skablins only goes up to player #11, but I'm painting all the linesplayers in anticipation of buying out all the available positions. Finishing number #14 means I have two more linesplayers to paint (#15 and #16) and then on to painting the specialist positionals. 10 down, 8 to go.
