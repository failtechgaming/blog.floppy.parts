# End of the line(players)

And with these final two, numbers 15 and 16, I finish the linesplayers for the Skaville Skablins. Which leads me to only have specialist positionals to work on now. Probably starting with the bomber, but don't hold me to that.

It is also here where I realized my terrible mistake in team-building. I haven't actually played my first game yet, but I realized my team has 3 secret weapons players and only 3 bribes to start with. So I can either play all my secret weapons for two drives and them lose them all, play 3 for one drive, then 1 for two more drives, then I'm down 3 players. It's really a lesson learned on how to play Goblins that I'm learning the hard way. Oh well.
